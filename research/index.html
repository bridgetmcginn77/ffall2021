<h2>Recipe Websites</h2>

<h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
<li><a href="https://valfre.com/">Valfre</a> has images with curved borders and outlines, which I want to use on my website because I find that it organizes the photographic content in a nice way. I also like how there are large images that stretch across the page; I think that could be beneficial for when I use multiple images of my ingredients.
<li> <a href="https://www.wildflowercases.com/">Wildflower Cases</a> is a strong example of a website with cohesive color themes. I will impliment this in my recipe website by sticking to a color palette. </li>
