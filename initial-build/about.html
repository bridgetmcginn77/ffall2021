    <h1>about</h1>
    <p> Afrofuturism is a cultural aesthetic, 
        philosophy of science and philosophy of 
        history that explores the developing 
        intersection of African diaspora culture 
        with technology. It was coined by Mark Dery 
        in 1993 and explored in the late 1990s through 
        conversations led by Alondra Nelson. 
        Afrofuturism addresses themes and concerns of 
        the African diaspora through technoculture 
        and speculative fiction, encompassing a 
        range of media and artists with a shared 
        interest in envisioning black futures 
        that stem from Afro-diasporic experiences. </p>
