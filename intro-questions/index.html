        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        
     <p>1. My name is Bridget and I am a junior studying Communication Design.</p> 


     <p>2. My favorite mediums are photography and graphic design, so I wanted to challenge myself and step into something I'm less comfortable with on the computer. </p>


     <p>3. The only coding I've ever done was a tiny session in Digital Studio my freshman fall.</p> 


     <p>4. How to successfully build a website for my portfolio.</p>


     <p>5. I expect that there is a lot more room for error and experimentaton when designing for screen.</p> 

        
     <p>6. I believe <a href="https://lonelyghost.co"> https://lonelyghost.co </a> exemplifies effective design because it is a website with interactive photos/products, a unique color theme, and exciting moving, textual elements that foster user involvement. </p>

     <p>7. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/topic/viceland" > https://www.vice.com/en/topic/viceland </a> exemplifies effective communication because their story titles, subtitles, and photos are all presented in a similar way, allowing for users to easily choose what news they want to read.</p>

        
     <p>8. I think that <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" > https://www.airbnb.com/ </a> is a website that works well because of its unlimited, easy-to-use features: community ratings, maps, photos, and location/date selections.  </p>
